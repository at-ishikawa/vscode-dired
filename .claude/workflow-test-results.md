# GitHub Actions Workflow Test Results

## Test Summary

Successfully tested the GitHub Actions workflows by:
1. Pushed commits to trigger test workflow
2. Created and pushed tag v0.2.0 to trigger publish workflow
3. Fixed issues found during testing

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ESLint Errors (Fixed ✅)
- **Issue**: Linting failed due to style warnings (== vs ===, missing semicolons)
- **Fix**: Updated code to use strict equality operators
- **Result**: All linting now passes

### 2. Cross-Platform Test Script (Fixed ✅)
- **Issue**: Windows couldn't run `./node_modules/.bin/mocha`
- **Fix**: Changed to use `mocha` directly in package.json scripts
- **Result**: Tests now pass on all platforms (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)

### 3. Missing VSCE_PAT Secret (Expected ⚠️)
- **Issue**: Publish workflow failed due to missing Personal Access Token
- **Fix Required**: Add `VSCE_PAT` secret to repository settings
- **Instructions**: See `.claude/publishing-setup.md`

## Current Workflow Status

### Test Workflow ✅
- Runs on: Push to master/main and pull requests
- Matrix: Ubuntu, macOS, Windows × Node 18.x, 20.x
- Status: **All tests passing**

### Publish Workflow ⚠️
- Triggers on: Version tags (e.g., v0.2.0)
- Status: **Requires VSCE_PAT secret**
- Steps completed:
  - ✅ Checkout code
  - ✅ Setup Node.js
  - ✅ Install dependencies
  - ✅ Run tests
  - ✅ Package extension
  - ❌ Publish to marketplace (needs VSCE_PAT)
  - ❌ Create GitHub release

## Next Steps

To enable automatic publishing:

1. **Create Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to https://dev.azure.com/[your-organization]/_usersSettings/tokens
   - Create token with Marketplace permissions

2. **Add Secret to Repository**:
   ```bash
   # Go to repository settings
   https://github.com/at-ishikawa/vscode-dired-mode/settings/secrets/actions
   
   # Add new secret:
   Name: VSCE_PAT
   Value: [Your Personal Access Token]
   ```

3. **Retry Publishing**:
   - The v0.2.0 tag is already created
   - Once VSCE_PAT is added, you can re-run the failed workflow
   - Or create a new tag (e.g., v0.2.1) to trigger a fresh publish
